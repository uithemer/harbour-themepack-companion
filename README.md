# Companion app example

This is the example of a companion app for a theme pack. The companion app lets your users contact you and ask for apps to be included in your theme with a single-click action. It also supports translation of the UI.

Feel free to fork it and use it on your projects.

## Notes

  * Most of the changes can be performed with a search&replace action, from *harbour-themepack-companion* to the name of your choice (remember it must start with *harbour-themepack-* in order to be recognized by themepacksupport).
  * Remember to change the app icon and the cover design in the *other* folder.
  * You can customize your e-mail address in *other/fetchicons.sh*.

## Licensing

The companion app is released under the terms of the GPLv3 license. However, you can still release your theme as closed source, as long as you publish changes of the companion app source files.
